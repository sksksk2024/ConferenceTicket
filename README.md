## Technologies used:
 - React;
 - Tailwind CSS;
 - GSAP;
 - Accesibility;
 - Pure CSS
 - Regex

## What I learned along the way
In this project, I learned a great deal, including:

 -   **Gaining a deep understanding of GSAP** and its applications for creating animations.
  -  **Switching from `vh/vw` to dvh/dvw** for improved responsiveness and layout handling.
  -  **Getting comfortable with creating personalized error messages** and developing custom error handlers for the frontend.
 -   **Reviewing all images in the projectâ€™s image folder** before starting, ensuring I was well-prepared for tasks like recreating images that couldn't be done with CSS (e.g., certain graphical elements).
  -  **Successfully deploying a full-stack app that was transformed into a frontend-only website using Netlify**!
  -  **Improving my organizational skills** and overall project structure.
